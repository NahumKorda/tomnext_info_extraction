Moonfare UK Ltd. (FRN: 947638) is an appointed representative of Khepri Advisers Limited (FRN: 692447) which is authorised and
regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority.

Moonfare does not make investment recommendations and no communication, through this website or in any other medium should be
construed as a recommendation for any security offered on or off this investment platform. Alternative investments in private placements,
and private equity investments via feeder funds in particular, are speculative and involve a high degree of risk and those investors who
cannot afford to lose their entire investment should not invest. Prospective investors should carefully consider the risk warnings and
disclosures for the respective fund or investment vehicle set out therein. The value of an investment may go down as well as up and
investors may not get back their money originally invested. Past performance is not necessarily a guide to future performance. An
investment in a fund or investment vehicle is not the same as a deposit with a banking institution. Please refer to the respective fund
documentation for details about potential risks, charges and expenses. Additionally, investors will typically receive illiquid and/or
restricted membership interests that may be subject to holding period requirements and/or liquidity concerns. In the most sensible
investment strategy for private equity investing, private equity should only be part of your overall investment portfolio. Further, the private
equity portion of your portfolio may include a balanced portfolio of different private equity funds. Investments in private equity are highly
illiquid and those investors who cannot hold an investment for the long term (at least 10 years) should not invest.
